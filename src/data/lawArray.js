              "introDescription": "Personal injury lawsuits arise from negligent or reckless conduct related to motor vehicle accidents, premises liability (such as slips/falls), professional malpractice, or nursing home abuse. The legal objective is generally to recover monetary compensation, though in some cases punitive damages may be sought."
              ,"description": "Anytime we suffer because of others, our human inclination is to seek compensation (or revenge), especially when we think the other person was negligent.  Although Scripture supports compensation in cases of negligence, unintentional accidents usually bear no penalties. But intentional or not, the actual pain or suffering remains to be endured."

              "introDescription": "Fifteen years after cars were invented, the first traffic law was created (in 1901) - a speed limit of 12 mph in Connecticut cities (and 15 mph for country roads). By 1937 the US hit a peak traffic death rate of 31 deaths per 100,000 population. That rate has steadily declined with the implementation of a host of traffic laws, ranging from auto manufacturing requirements to roadway design and signage to DUI & school zone regulation."
              ,"description": "For a car to operate safely, many elements must come together very well - from auto and road design and construction to traffic laws and their enforcement.  God, as both Creator and Sustainer of His creation, not only has a perfect plan for all of creation, He is working His plan in and through each of us who share in His image."

But we often live with a presumption of distrust and rely on our legal and justice system to hold others accountable for their promises."
              ,"description": "Keeping our word, even if it hurts, builds trust with others.  Not making promises we cannot keep also helps build our credibility.  While breaking a contract (such as a lease) may be morally acceptable if penalties are paid, covenants are never morally broken.  Marriage is Biblically a covenant, yet often perceived as merely a contract, reminding us that only God is fully reliable and faithful."

While some bankruptcies simply work out a better repayment plan, others allow for disposing of unsecured debts, enabling creditors to be paid more than they might otherwise receive."
              ,"description": "People normally have mixed feelings about bankruptcy - anger from an unpaid creditor to thankfulness from the strapped debtor with no other options.  Jewish law expected debt relief every 7 years, whether in the form of monetary debt or debt as a slave.  This merciful action demonstrated value and compassion to individuals, whether deserved or not, and laid the foundation of merciful forgiveness of sins offered by Jesus, which the law of Moses could never attain."

They review contracts, negotiate agreements between buyers and sellers, give title opinions, attend closings, and more, often adding a sense of security to what is normally the largest purchase of the buyer's life."
                ,"description": "While buying a home can be stressful, it is often also a time of immense joy.  The new owner likely searched for and finally found the best possible house they could afford, resulting in the happiness of getting what was intensely needed or desired.  But often this type of happiness is fleeting and quickly replaced by a fear of missing payments or the dismay in finding foundational problems.  Joy feels similar to happiness, but is fundamentally different."

It is a key way for one nation to limit or reduce the amount of a good being imported into the country, improving the economics of producing that product domestically. If a country needs a foreign product, it normally forgoes any tariff. Tariffs of one country may vary wildly from those of another because of the unique needs and resources of those people.',

Tariffs, implements by fallible humans, can be implemented with good intent but have negative long-term impacts.

All laws found within our nation are intended to bring these goals to fruition.',

While the Constitution's framers shared the centuries-old view that all citizens owed a duty of loyalty to their home nation, they included the Treason Clause not so much to underscore the seriousness of such a betrayal, but to guard against the historic use of treason prosecutions by repressive governments to silence otherwise legitimate political opposition. The Constitution specifically limits the offense of treason to only two types of conduct: (1) “levying war” against the United States; or (2) “adhering to [the] enemies [of the United States], giving them aid and comfort.",
                        description: "While treason was very narrowly defined in the U.S. Constitution so that it was not abused by man, God and most societies do expect some level of loyalty to their sovereign rule.  While every human has broken at least some of God's laws, it is the active resistance against God glory (as it has been clearly revealed in both Christ and Creation) that warrants the penalty of treason. Unbelief in the face of God's revealed Glory is indeed treasonous."

      introDescription: 'Likely the most heinous of unlawful behavior, murder includes first-degree (willful and premeditated), second-degree (willful, but not intended), third-degree (voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, including reckless and negligent homicide).  Justifiable homicide (think self-defense) can also be determined and is not a crime. Life imprisonment is the normal sentence rendered for murder, although 27 states have capital punishment as a legal option.',

God prohibited murder with the Ten Commandments and then spelled out the penalties (including death) for different situations. God expressed great displeasure in the first recorded murder in the Bible - Cain killing Abel - but surprisingly protected Cain from being murdered himself. Although a murder victim's time on this earth ends, the soul continues in a realm governed by a God who exists independent of time."

      introDescription: 'There are many forms of theft - burglary, fraud, robbery, shoplifting, identity, credit card, embezzlement, and more. All these involve taking, without consent, something of value for the benefit of the thief.  While physical property theft has been cut in half over the last two decades (except for a post-COVID uptick), cyber theft has been increasing rapidly.  Insurance experts believe only 1/3 of all theft is reported and less than 30% of stolen property is ever recovered.',
      description: '“Do not steal” is stated simply in the Ten Commandments. In order to properly deter theft, Biblical penalties usually call for a much larger restitution than what was originally taken.  Although there can be many reasons why one would steal, it fundamentally comes from the thief putting his or her needs over those of another.  In other words, a lack of humility.'    },

      introDescription: "The purpose of criminal law today includes both protection of the public and reform of the offender. Historically, however, these crimes were considered morally wrong and the law's purpose was to make the offender give retribution for harm done and expiate (make amends, atone for) his moral guilt. Punishment was then meted out in proportion to the extent and type of guilt of the accused. Whether it included theft, assault, rape, murder, or other crimes, criminal law nearly always involves one or more people improperly treating another.",
      description: "Biblical criminal justice often included restitution of some form - such as returning four sheep for one stolen - which paved the way for restoring the relationship between the perpetrator and victim.  Only the severest of penalties, such as enslavement and even death, were given when restoration was considered impossible.  It is notable that Jesus Himself was counted as a criminal and given the harshest penalty possible, yet it was only by this penalty was man's relationship to God restored."

All have the basic intent to deceive another for gain and there is nearly universal agreement that this is wrong.',

Bearing false witness against a neighbor was important enough for God to list in the Ten Commandments.  Numerous other passages warn against deceiving others or being deceived by others.

It is a higher standard of proof than preponderance of evidence, commonly used in civil cases. The higher standard is used because the stakes are much higher in criminal cases: imprisonment, social stigma, and even loss of life.',

However, this unboundedness makes it inherently difficult for humans to believe in such things as a virgin birth and resurrection from the dead. This doubt is not only reasonable; it is to be expected.  Belief in an incomprehensible god will include doubt, while unbelief is a willful refusal to believe Who God is.'

All evidence must be relevant and can be testimonial (from a witness), documentary (written), demonstrative (anything that shows a fact at issue in the case, such as DNA testing), or real (an actual object or thing relating to the case, such as a bullet).  It also must be admissible - that is, not items such as hearsay, misleading, privileged (such as shared with an attorney or priest), or what simply wastes the court's time.",
            description: 'The first fingerprint evidence used to convict a person occurred in 1910.  DNA testing, once considered impossible, if not magical, was first used to convict in 1987.  These types of evidence give assurance that proper justice is being served, especially in crimes where there are no witnesses.  So how does one believe in the existence of God, Who is invisible?  His reality is proven by both documentary evidence (the Bible) and testimony of the Holy Spirit to those who believe in the form of faith.'

It requires good laws, properly enforced, with unbiased judges and juries who ensure right action is taken in each situation.  And most of what we consider justice is retributive - designed to protect the innocent from wrong-doing.  It does not normally include distributive justice, such as social justice, and almost never touches on personal righteousness.',
            description: "Justice implies making things right in a legal or societal sphere.  Righteousness works on a more personal level (making its popular appeal somewhat less).  The Bible often uses both words together because Godly justice is fully restorative - something only God can do.  Our legal justice system may well penalize a burglar, but cannot fully restore the victim of all possessions or of prior innocence, let alone restore the burglar to a proper level of righteousness. God's purpose in justice is to make all things right."

This ideal, however, can break down in many ways.',
                description: 'While overt bribes or intimidation may be uncommon, each juror and judge brings some personal bias or connection to the accused - an experience, belief, affiliation, or desire.  Whether these may help or hurt the accused, no one is totally unbiased or independent from another person.  Only God is totally independent.'

                introDescription: 'In the U.S. civil rights refer to basic rights that every citizen has under the Constitution and laws of the American government. This includes protection from discrimination based on age, gender, religion, skin color, disability or nationality. Civil rights laws also give the critical rights of free speech, religion, privacy, a fair trial, assembly and freedom of thought.',
                description: "Martin Luther King Jr. aptly quoted Amos 5:24, “But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.” The need for, and power behind, civil rights is that they apply to every citizen.  President Lincoln quoted the nation's founders when he recalled that “all men are created equal”. Every person is created in the image of God, which then necessarily and tangibly reveals God's closeness to each of us."

                introDescription: 'Intellectual property law covers trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets.  These laws are designed to foster creative endeavors by giving due credit and protection to the originator of the product or ideas for a period of time.  Unlike land or other physical possessions, intellectual property can often be replicated for personal gain - a person could buy a unique song, movie or drug and then sell replications for less than the original creator, cheapening the original effort and value.',
                description: 'Making something completely new is hard work and these laws honor both creativity and creator.  Although only God has made something from nothing by His Word (all of creation!), He gives each of us the excitement and satisfaction of using His creation to fashion new things. When we take sole credit for our “creations” without any tribute to our Creator, it is much like an intellectual property violation.'

                introDescription: "Immigration law defines a person's citizenship and residency status, which binds them with rights and obligations, and includes how a non-resident of the U.S. may gain residency, citizenship, and visitation rights. US immigration law is designed to bring in people who have skills to contribute to our economy, but also specifically seeks to unify families that have been dispersed and protect refugees and people at risk.",
                description: 'For over 400 years the early Jews lived in Egypt.  They learned there what living in a foreign land was like, knowing that loving acceptance from those around you makes life so much better than without it.  If we, as Americans, trace our family heritage, most of us will find that our ancestors were once immigrants.  Seeing ourselves and others as all “fellow sojourners” in this world helps us to love others more deeply.'

                introDescription: 'Although divorce is the most common reason for consulting a family law attorney, the associated issues of child custody/support/paternity, prenuptial agreements, and domestic violence restraining orders are also dealt with.  Non-divorce related issues include adoption, estate planning, guardianship and foster care, with technology raising new issues such as IVF and surrogacy. But the driving element of family law is to ensure that family members provide fairly for ex-spouses/partners and especially children.',
                description: 'Providing for children following a separation or divorce is much more relevant today, given that the percentage of children living with only one parent has doubled over the last 50 years. Exactly what should be provided in each case is why laws and lawyers are needed, but nearly everyone agrees that providing for your own family is inherently needed and good.'

Although some international law originates from the UN's International Court of Justice (ICJ), the ICJ relies on accepted conventions and customs, and most heavily on treaties between sovereign states.  Formal treaties are written and span the whole spectrum of international relations: peace, trade (including tariffs), defense, territorial boundaries, human rights, law enforcement, environmental matters, and many others.",
                description: "While international law recognizes the supremacy of individual sovereign nations, the Bible is clear that even these “sovereign” nations are under God's authority and power."
