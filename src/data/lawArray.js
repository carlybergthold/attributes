              "introDescription": "Personal injury lawsuits arise from negligent or reckless conduct related to motor vehicle accidents, premises liability (such as slips/falls), professional malpractice, or nursing home abuse. The legal objective is generally to recover monetary compensation, though in some cases punitive damages may be sought."
              ,"description": "Anytime we suffer because of others, our human inclination is to seek compensation (or revenge), especially when we think the other person was negligent.  Although Scripture supports compensation in cases of negligence, unintentional accidents usually bear no penalties. But intentional or not, the actual pain or suffering remains to be endured."

              "introDescription": "Fifteen years after cars were invented, the first traffic law was created (in 1901) - a speed limit of 12 mph in Connecticut cities (and 15 mph for country roads). By 1937 the US hit a peak traffic death rate of 31 deaths per 100,000 population. That rate has steadily declined with the implementation of a host of traffic laws, ranging from auto manufacturing requirements to roadway design and signage to DUI & school zone regulation."
              ,"description": "For a car to operate safely, many elements must come together very well - from auto and road design and construction to traffic laws and their enforcement.  God, as both Creator and Sustainer of His creation, not only has a perfect plan for all of creation, He is working His plan in and through each of us who share in His image."

              "introDescription": "A contract is a promise enforceable by law. If a promise can be trusted, such as within a family, there is no need for a contract. But we often live with a presumption of distrust and rely on our legal and justice system to hold others accountable for their promises."
              ,"description": "Keeping our word, even if it hurts, builds trust with others.  Not making promises we cannot keep also helps build our credibility.  While breaking a contract (such as a lease) may be morally acceptable if penalties are paid, covenants are never morally broken.  Marriage is Biblically a covenant, yet often perceived as merely a contract, reminding us that only God is fully reliable and faithful."

              "name": "Bankruptcy",
              "introDescription": "Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding carried out to free individuals or businesses from their debts - offering a fresh start for people who can no longer afford to pay their bills. While some bankruptcies simply work out a better repayment plan, others allow for disposing of unsecured debts, enabling creditors to be paid more than they might otherwise receive."
              ,"description": "People normally have mixed feelings about bankruptcy - anger from an unpaid creditor to thankfulness from the strapped debtor with no other options.  Jewish law expected debt relief every 7 years, whether in the form of monetary debt or debt as a slave.  This merciful action demonstrated value and compassion to individuals, whether deserved or not, and laid the foundation of merciful forgiveness of sins offered by Jesus, which the law of Moses could never attain."

                "introDescription": "Real estate attorneys help facilitate real estate transactions, whether a new build or sale of an existing home. They review contracts, negotiate agreements between buyers and sellers, give title opinions, attend closings, and more, often adding a sense of security to what is normally the largest purchase of the buyer's life."
                ,"description": "While buying a home can be stressful, it is often also a time of immense joy.  The new owner likely searched for and finally found the best possible house they could afford, resulting in the happiness of getting what was intensely needed or desired.  But often this type of happiness is fleeting and quickly replaced by a fear of missing payments or the dismay in finding foundational problems.  Joy feels similar to happiness, but is fundamentally different."
