Some supported the steady-state theory, which states that the universe has always existed and will continue to survive without noticeable change. Others believed in the Big Bang theory, which states that the universe was created in a massive explosion-like event billions of years ago (later determined to be approximately 13.8 billion years)…..The discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) in 1941 constitutes a major development in modern physical cosmology….. In 1964, US physicist Arno Penzias and radio-astronomer Robert Woodrow Wilson rediscovered the CMB…. and new measurements were accepted as important evidence for a hot early Universe (big bang theory) and as evidence against the rival steady state theory.[4] In 1978, Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for their joint measurement.”  Evolutionary Beliefs and Creation (2/6/19 article from Pew Research): Roughly 1/3 of US adults believe humans have always existed in their current form (i.e. consistent with Biblical conservative creation account).  Another 1/3 believe humans evolved over time, but that this process was guided by God or a higher power (i.e. consistent with a more liberal Biblical account or intelligent design theory).
