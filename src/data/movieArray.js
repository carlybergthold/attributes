        commentary: "Every movie is a creative endeavor - from development to production to distribution. It all starts from nothing but an idea.  Cameron notes “Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality.”  Evidence of this type of creativeness is found in each of his films.  The Na'vi language in Avatar (1000 words not resembling any human language) was created entirely from scratch by linguist Dr. Paul R. Frommer.  After Cameron had the initial idea for Avatar, production had to wait a full decade for photorealistic computer-generated character technology to catch up to his creative desires.  Of course, these human desires first had to be created in the heart and mind of a very creative God. God is the beginning of all things.",

Even as Adam & Eve pursued equality with God, our imaginations conjure up the means, like Doc's DeLorean, which could make it so.  It could allow us, like Marty, to correct our past mistakes, or maybe even experience key events of history, glimpse into our future, and even avoid our own physical death.  H.G. Wells was the first in history to document the idea of time travel - this not being until 1895 in his book, 'The Time Machine.'  Maybe, before then, people simply accepted the present as God's gift."

Every movie ever made is an attempt to control or influence the viewer by the film's creators.  Power is essential to life. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) explains that the Infinity Stones' essence existed before the Big Bang and was made into Stones only after the universe began.  In real life this pre-creation power actually did exist, in the hand of Almighty God, and He has never relinquished His ownership.  Even Loki knows that!"

At the least, we desire the same feeling as when a hobbit is happily at home in the Shire - that my soul is deeply content and my life is aligned with my soul.

Nolan explained that his Inception cast mimicked roles required in filmmaking: Cobb is the director, his partner Arthur, the producer, Ariadne is the production designer, Eames is the actor, Saito is the studio funding the project, and Fischer (the one being influenced in the movie while dreaming) is the audience. From our perspective, God's plans are a movie of sorts.  One that requires all of His attributes working together to become what He intends.
