    Synopsis: "James Cameron directed The Terminator (1984), Aliens (1986), Titanic (1997), Avatar (2009) and others.  The Physics and English major drop-out left a truck driving job to enter the film industry after seeing Star Wars in 1977, becoming one of the most well-known writer directors ever.  Titanic remained the highest grossing movie ever for 12 years - finally topped by Avatar, the first movie to make more than $2 billion at the box office. ",
    "Status?": "Complete",
    Commentary: "Every movie is a creative endeavor - from development to production to distribution. It all starts from nothing but an idea.  Cameron notes “Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality.”  Evidence of this type of creativeness is found in each of his films.  The Na'vi language in Avatar (1000 words not resembling any human language) was created entirely from scratch by linguist Dr. Paul R. Frommer.  After Cameron had the initial idea for Avatar, production had to wait a full decade for photorealistic computer-generated character technology to catch up to his creative desires.  Of course, these human desires first had to be created in the heart and mind of a very creative God. God is the beginning of all things.",

    Commentary: "Our desire to time travel has been captured in many films and TV shows - from “Dr. Who” to “Deja Vu” to “The Terminator”.  Although time is an integral part of God’s creation, we yearn to be like Him, independent of this apparent constraint. Even as Adam & Eve pursued equality with God, our imaginations conjure up the means, like Doc’s DeLorean, which could make it so.  It could allow us, like Marty, to correct our past mistakes, or maybe even experience key events of history, glimpse into our future, and even avoid our own physical death.  H.G. Wells was the first in history to document the idea of time travel - this not being until 1895 in his book, \"The Time Machine”.  Maybe, before then, people simply accepted the present as God’s gift. \n\nMarty McFly: Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't have enough road to get up to 88.\nDr. Emmett Brown: Roads?

    Synopsis: "After being anointed as the next king of the jungle, young lion cub Simba is every bit as eager to take his proud father Mufasa's place as the king (voiced by James Earl Jones). However, this makes Simba's villainous uncle Scar jealous of him. But when Mufasa is suddenly murdered by Scar, Simba feels responsible for his death and runs away from home, only realizing later that he must return home to stop Scar's evil reign and fulfill his destiny as the new king.",

    Commentary: "Being King means being at the very top - lord over all those around.  Earthly kings have been portrayed in many great movies - from Aragorn (Lord of the Rings) to King Henry VIII to yet another lion named Aslan (The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe). Being sovereign means your will is done.  This creates many classic confrontations with those who may (and always do) oppose the true king.  While only God in heaven is the true king, we often choose to forge ahead with our own will, even if we are truly His.  It’s only when we know who God is and who we are in Him that we become more open to the subservient role. \n\nMufasa's Ghost: You have forgotten who you are and so have forgotten me. Look inside yourself Simba. You are more than what you have become."

    Movie: "Good Will Hunting - 1997",
    Type: "Drama Romance",
    Synopsis: "A young adult by the name of Will Hunting has always been living in the slums, spending his nights at bars and batting cages with his best friends. However, he has an amazing talent in Mathematics. When Will is almost sent to jail, a professor at MIT decides to bail him out under the condition that he works with him in math every week and that he visits a therapist. Little does he know that, by accepting the conditions, the therapist teacher, Sean, will change his life in so many ways.",
    "Status?": "Complete",
    Commentary: "Many movies focus on teacher learner relationships - because everyone needs direction in life.  It is most helpful for us to be both a good student and a good teacher. A good teacher will strive to learn who we are - well enough to really understand our needs - and then help us discover our best way forward.  Will needed Sean to figure things out - especially when a girl enters the scene! With God, we must be a good learner because He is the perfect Teacher.  He knows us better than anyone and His guidance is always true and our best way forward. That, my friend, is a perfect match.\n\nSean: [during a therapy session] You're not perfect, sport, and let me save you the suspense: this girl you've met, she's not perfect either. But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other."

    Movie: "Matrix - 1999",
    Type: "Action     Sci-Fi ",
    Synopsis: "Thomas Anderson lives two lives. By day a computer programmer and by night a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned reality, but when befriended by Morpheus, a messiah of sorts who presents Neo with the choice of living in continued deception (blue pill) or a truth far beyond his imagination (red pill). He chooses red and learns that everyone in the world is a slave, born into bondage.",
    "Status?": "Complete",
    Commentary: "We watch movies to temporarily experience a different reality from our own.  Neo chose to permanently leave one reality (of bondage and deception) so that he could fully enter another reality - one that was actually true.  The death and resurrection of Jesus is a life-altering truth called the Gospel.  Believing it changes our perspective on nearly everything - our identity, our purpose and our relationship to others. It is indeed a “red” pill which frees. \n\nMorpheus (to Neo): This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.\n\nMorpheus: You have to let it all go, Neo. Fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind."

    Type: "Adventure Comedy",
    Synopsis: "Wes Anderson wrote and directed the likes of The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) and Moonrise Kingdom (2012).  Wesley Wales Anderson was born in Houston, Texas to his ‘archaeologist turned real estate agent’ mother and his father, who worked in advertising and PR. His parents divorced when he was a young child, an event that he described as the most crucial event of his brothers’ and his growing up.  At least one of his movie characters is usually a grown man seeking the approval of a parent or parent figure.",
    "Status?": "Complete",
    Commentary: "Sitting down to a Wes Anderson film for the first time means you will be experiencing something truly different. Of course, every film writer, director, actor and person is unique, just as every movie is unique.  We all have different families, histories, foibles and fingerprints. Just as important, though, are our similarities - our basic anatomy, our desire to be special and the fact that we are all created in God’s image.  And even though we are all in His image, our biggest theological error is to strip God-ness from God and assume that He thinks and acts like me.  Only God is God.\n\nWes Anderson quote: That’s the kind of movie that I like to make, where there is an invented reality and the audience is going to go someplace where hopefully they've never been before.

    Movie: "Jurassic Park - 1993",
    Type: "Action  Adventure  Sci-Fi",
    Synopsis: "Huge advancements in scientific technology have enabled a mogul to create an island full of living dinosaurs. John Hammond has invited four individuals, along with his two grandchildren, to join him at Jurassic Park. But will everything go according to plan? A park employee attempts to steal dinosaur embryos, critical security systems are shut down and it now becomes a race for survival with dinosaurs roaming freely over the island.",
    "Status?": "Complete",
    Commentary: "Just because we know how to do something does not mean we should do it.  In this classic, John Hammond feels that it is only natural to exploit technology discovered, while Dr. Alan Grant wisely realizes that nothing good will come of dangerous dinosaurs being recreated, and then spends the whole movie proving that he was correct. True wisdom, however, does not simply refrain from doing stupid things. It compels us to proactively use our knowledge and truth for ultimate good. And since only God is perfectly good, we are wise to sync our endeavors up with His.  \n\nDr. Ian Malcolm: God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.\nDr. Ellie Sattler: Dinosaurs eat man. Woman inherits the earth."

    Movie: "12 Angry Men - 1957",
    Type: "Crime   Drama",
    Synopsis: "In this older but classic tale, the defense and the prosecution have rested, and the jury is filing into the jury room to decide if a young man is guilty or innocent of murdering his father. What begins as an open-and-shut case of murder soon becomes a detective story that presents a succession of clues creating doubt, and a mini-drama of each of the jurors' prejudices and preconceptions about the trial, the accused, and each other.",
    "Status?": "Complete",
    Commentary: "Wrath has a bad reputation.  When we view it only as the anger which we humans too often display, it brings with it a host of evils - biases, selfishness, revenge, loss of emotional control.  Like many movies, 12 Angry Men includes many of these evils, but in such a way as to refocus on what true wrath is - a just and loving insistence on rightness.  Without God’s perfect wrath - His just and loving insistence on what is right - there can be no justice in the world, nor an ultimate rightness of the world.\n\nJuror #8 (played by Henry Fonda): Let me ask you this: Do you really think the boy'd shout out a thing like that so the whole neighborhood could hear him? I don't think so - he's much too bright for that.\nJuror #10: Bright? He's a common ignorant slob. He don't even speak good English.\nJuror #11: [who has a foreign accent] He *doesn't* speak good English."
