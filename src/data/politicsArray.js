        liberalPosition: "Democrats are fighting back to restore reproductive freedom for every woman in every state.",
        conservativePosition: "We (Republicans) proudly stand for families and Life. We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF fertility treatments.",
        commentary: "This political debate over whose will should “win” is both fervent and polarizing.  Both parties, however, mistakenly elevate the sovereignty of one person over that of another.  Democrats deeply believe a woman has full authority over her own body.  Republicans are convinced that even the yet fully-formed will and body of the unborn child has the ultimate right to life.  An unwanted pregnancy results in a clash of these human wills that can have devastating consequences. But the mother, father and child are all subject first and only to God's authority, which is supreme and will endure for all eternity.",

        conservativePosition: "We (Republicans) will restore Government of, by, and for the People, ensuring Accountability, protecting Individual Liberties, and fixing our once very corrupt Elections. We commit to upholding the Constitution of the United States, appointing judges who respect the rule of law, and defending the Rights of all Americans to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.",
        commentary: "Both parties desire to live within enduring roots and unchanging ideals.  Republicans see this as the Constitution - literally.  Democrats also see it as the Constitution - but as it might better become.  Certainly the U.S. will experience a sea of constant change regardless of party, even as each party clings to anchors of ideals they never want changed.  But it is only God Who can be counted on to never change.",

        commentary: "Republicans see families as the core of our nation for which all policies should eventually benefit.  Democrats would agree, though define family much more broadly, even as a collection of diverse individuals.  Both parties ideally seek to help others live a better life than they would without them. This type of thinking - to rationally view ourselves as someone who can benefit others - can center our purpose and motivate our actions daily.  It is the essence of being humble when we accurately assess ourselves and seek to lift others up.  Not that He would brag on Himself, but Jesus did humility better than anyone!",

        conservativePosition: "Likewise, the Republican Party must ensure the equal application of law to all regardless of political affiliation or personal beliefs. ...We proudly stand for families and Life.",
        commentary: "Both parties seek to honor two things which are precious to God - preservation of life and justice.  Republicans have historically favored the death penalty because they believe (as Scripture lays out) that it is a just penalty for the premeditated murder of another and it is needed in a sinful culture to curb violent behavior by emphasizing just how precious each life is - know that you will lose your life if you take another's.  Democrats desire justice as well, but question our government's ability to execute it fairly - noting that killing even one innocent alleged murderer is unjust.  The US justice system is one of the best in the world, but also is most certainly imperfect.  Only God's justice is perfect.",

        commentary: "Both parties know the importance of a good education. Teachers guide students to learn and become someone better. Democrats lay most responsibility on the government while Republicans rely more on parents to guide their children's education. Both want to instill values and purpose in every child's life.  God has placed within us all a need and desire to learn and He alone is the perfect educator.",

        conservativePosition: "Republicans will unleash Energy Production from all sources, including nuclear, to immediately slash Inflation and power American homes, cars, and factories with reliable, abundant, and affordable Energy.",
        commentary: "Both parties recognize that we need energy to live and that we must rely on a variety of energy sources while mitigating the harmful effects of each. We have been abundantly blessed by God with each and every energy resource we have.  He also provides everything else we need to live an abundant life - including our next breath!",

        commentary: "Both parties want to be good stewards of God's creation.  This includes making good use of what resources are available while not permanently damaging our environment. The key to proper creation stewardship lies in how vigorously we as humans tap into the creative nature God has instilled within us - to create what we currently do not have.",

        conservativePosition: "The Republican Plan is to return Peace through Strength, rebuilding our Military and Alliances, countering China, defeating terrorism, building an Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield, promoting American Values, securing our Homeland and Borders, and reviving our Defense Industrial Base.",
        commentary: "Each party desires world peace, yet recognizes this does not happen on its own. Both indicate the need for a range of tangible responses to meet conflicts as they come.  True peace, however, is far beyond the mere containment or absence of conflict - it is, for a nation as well as an individual, believing that you are safe, whole, healthy and complete.",

We will protect Free Speech online.",
        commentary: "Both parties would free us to do many things, even citing freedom as the key character of our nation.  But then create laws and regulations which stifle some of this independence.  It seems a necessary balance - every individual yearns for independence, yet realizes interdependence (which requires some individual restraint) is reality.  God alone is fully independent.",

        conservativePosition: "Republicans will increase Transparency, promote Choice and Competition, and expand access to new Affordable Healthcare and prescription drug options. We will protect Medicare, and ensure Seniors receive the care they need without being burdened by excessive costs.",
        commentary: "Both parties want to ensure that people are saved from the negative effects of ill health.  Emergency rooms, the most common provider of urgent care in the U.S., are required to provide at least stabilizing treatment for anyone who enters, and a Dec 2017 study in healthaffairs.orgshowed the same rate of ER use for working-age insured and uninsured.  So most of the party differences are about who pays for what, not whether life-saving care should be provided.  Of course, while ER's do save many lives, physical death is an eventual certainty for all of us.  But God alone can save a soul for eternity.",

Through it all, the United States must continue to be a beacon of hope and opportunity.",
        conservativePosition: "Republicans offer an aggressive plan to stop the open-border policies that have opened the floodgates to a tidal wave of illegal Aliens, deadly drugs, and Migrant Crime. We will end the Invasion at the Southern Border, restore Law and Order, protect American Sovereignty, and deliver a Safe and Prosperous Future for all Americans.",
        commentary: "Both parties seek an immigration policy which is best for our country. Democrats believe in lower immigration hurdles in order to gain the obvious benefits which immigrants bring to our national table.  Republicans are much more aggressive to protect our country from the risks associated with uncontrolled immigration. When anyone eagerly desires what is best for another, they are being jealous FOR the other.  In this case, both parties are being jealous for our country.  God so much wants the best for those who love Him that He calls Himself “Jealous”.",

We trust Parents!  ...We commit to reducing Housing, Education, and Healthcare costs, while lowering everyday expenses, and increasing opportunities.",
        commentary: "Both parties want to have a positive impact on each citizen.  Democrats do tend toward more governmental presence while Republicans generally seek less.  Regardless of party, governmental influence, both good or bad, is everywhere - from our mailbox to our paycheck to our roads to the holidays we celebrate and much more.  Still, there are places largely free of governmental presence - our homes, our minds, our will.  Not so with God's presence - whether we perceive it as good or bad, He is everywhere, even in our very being.",

        commentary: "Both parties want broader access to information available on the internet.  Knowledge is power - those who do not have access to information are disadvantaged in this world. But even with perfect internet access, finding the right and accurate information we truly need is difficult.  And it will likely never be able to predict the future with 100% accuracy (even though AI may help some!).

Republicans favor the traditional view of marriage and family, while Democrats seek much broader definitions.  The purpose, however, is the same - to have a sense of belonging and intimacy with others who care.  God has given each of us this need to connect with others, as well as with Him.",

",
        commentary: "Republicans support an all-powerful military to deter all opposition and thus maintain peace in the world. While Democrats often seek to reduce military spending, they also seek to keep our forces unmatched in the world.  Both parties seek good through overwhelming power and authority.  But even at a spend rate of nearly one trillion dollars/year, the US military routinely runs into the human limitations of proper resourcing, prioritization and capabilities.

The party also has notable centrist and social democratic factions.\" (Wiki)",

The early Republican Party consisted of northern Protestants, factory workers, professionals, businessmen, prosperous farmers, and after the Civil War, former black slaves.” (Wiki)",
        commentary: "According to Wikipedia, the Republican Party was established in 1854 while the Democratic Party started in 1828, making it now possibly the world's oldest active political party. Both parties may make it many more decades, if not centuries.  However, neither are even close to eternal.  God alone is eternal, existing independent of time.",

We will expand access to Primary Care and support Policies that help Seniors remain in their homes and maintain Financial Security.",
        commentary: "Democrats would usually prefer compassionate government social programs to expand, erring on the side of giving too much than too little. “Heartless Conservative” Republicans would indeed like to limit government's involvement in social programs by clearly defining and limiting governmental aid to those with true need. Both parties clearly desire to alleviate needs of the truly distressed, one focusing more on government and the other on nongovernmental means.  However, both often choose indirect methods to help others (i.e. just send money) versus the hands-on, side-pierced, heart-filled compassion of Christ.",

Most taxpayers spend 13 hours and $240 annually just to prepare and file their tax return (per the 2021 1040 tax form) and often engage in this effort without fully understanding what they did!  Both parties would like a more understandable tax code.  Most people also want a simple and understandable version of God (often one which only aligns with what we like!) - but God is, and will always be, much more than we can possibly fathom.",
