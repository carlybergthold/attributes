        conservativePosition: "We (Republicans)…affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.",
        commentary: "This political debate over whose will should “win” is both fervent and polarizing.  Both parties, however, mistakenly elevate the sovereignty of one person over that of another.  Democrats deeply believe a woman has full authority over her own body.  Republicans are convinced that even the yet fully-formed will and body of the unborn child has the ultimate right to life, regardless of the parents' desire.  An unwanted pregnancy results in a clash of these human wills that can have devastating consequences. But the mother, father and child are all subject first and only to God's authority, which is supreme and will endure for all eternity.",

That protest is among the highest forms of patriotism. That our fates and fortunes are bound to rise and fall together. That even when we fall short of our highest ideals, we never stop trying to build a more perfect union.",
        conservativePosition: "We (Republicans) believe in the Constitution as our founding document. We believe the Constitution was written not as a flexible document, but as our enduring covenant.  We believe our constitutional system — limited government, separation of powers, Federalism, and the rights of the people — must be preserved, uncompromised for future generations.",
        commentary: "Both parties desire to live within enduring roots and unchanging ideals.  Republicans see this as the Constitution - literally.  Democrats also see it as the Constitution - but as it might better become.  Certainly the U.S. will experience a sea of constant change regardless of party, even as each party clings to anchors of ideals they never want changed.  But it is only God Who can be counted on to never change.",

        commentary: "Republicans see families as the core of our nation for which all policies should eventually benefit.  Democrats would agree, though define family much more broadly, even as a collection of diverse individuals.  Both parties ideally seek to help others live a better life than they would without them. This type of thinking - to rationally view ourselves as someone who can benefit others - can center our purpose and motivate our actions daily.  It is the essence of being humble when we accurately assess ourselves and seek to lift others up.  Not that He would brag on Himself, but Jesus did humility better than anyone!",

        conservativePosition: "The Republican Party, a party of law and order, must make clear in words and action that every human life matters….The constitutionality of the death penalty is firmly settled by its explicit mention in the Fifth Amendment.",
        commentary: "Both parties seek to honor two things which are precious to God - preservation of life and justice.  Republicans favor the death penalty because they believe (as Scripture lays out) that it is a just penalty for the premeditated murder of another and it is needed in a sinful culture to curb violent behavior by emphasizing just how precious each life is - know that you will lose your life if you take another's.  Democrats desire justice as well, but question our government's ability to execute it fairly - noting that killing even one innocent alleged murderer is unjust.  The US justice system is one of the best in the world, but also is most certainly imperfect.  Only God's justice is perfect.",

        commentary: "Both parties know the importance of a good education. Teachers guide students to learn and become someone better. Democrats lay most responsibility on the government while Republicans rely more on parents to guide their children's education. Both want to instill values and purpose in every child's life.

        commentary: "Both parties recognize that we need energy to live and that we must rely on a variety of energy sources while mitigating the harmful effects of each. We have been abundantly blessed by God with each and every energy resource we have.  He also provides everything else we need to live an abundant life - including our next breath!",

        commentary: "Both parties want to be good stewards of God's creation.  This includes making good use of what resources are available while not permanently damaging our environment. The key to proper creation stewardship lies in how vigorously we as humans tap into the creative nature God has instilled within us - to create what we currently do not have.",

We will stand up to the forces of authoritarianism, not aid and abet their rise, and we will speak and act with clarity and purpose on behalf of human rights wherever they are under threat.",
        conservativePosition: "As Americans and as Republicans, we wish for peace — so we insist on strength. We will make America safe. We seek friendship with all peoples and all nations, but we recognize and are prepared to deal with evil in the world.",
        commentary: "Each party desires world peace, yet recognizes this does not happen on its own. Both indicate the need for a range of tangible responses to meet conflicts as they come.  True peace, however, is far beyond the mere containment or absence of conflict - it is, for a nation as well as an individual, believing that you are safe, whole, healthy and complete.",

        conservativePosition: "We (Republicans) believe political freedom and economic freedom are indivisible…. when united, they are invincible….  Prosperity provides the means by which citizens and their families can maintain their independence from government, raise their children by their own values, practice their faith, and build communities of cooperation and mutual respect.",
        commentary: "Both parties would free us to do many things, often citing freedom as the key character of our nation.  But then create laws and regulations which stifle some of this independence.  It seems a necessary balance - every individual yearns for independence, yet realizes interdependence (which requires some individual restraint) is reality.  God alone is fully independent.",

        conservativePosition: "To guarantee first-rate care for the needy, we (Republicans) propose to block grant Medicaid and other payments and to assist all patients, including those with pre-existing conditions, to obtain coverage in a robust consumer market.",
        commentary: "Both parties want to ensure that people are saved from the negative effects of ill health.  Emergency rooms, the most common provider of urgent care in the U.S., are required to provide at least stabilizing treatment for anyone who enters, and a Dec 2017 study in healthaffairs.orgshowed the same rate of ER use for working-age insured and uninsured.  So most of the party differences are about who pays for what, not whether life-saving care should be provided.  Of course, while ER's do save many lives, physical death is an eventual certainty for all of us.  But God alone can save a soul for eternity.",

        commentary: "Both parties seek an immigration policy which is best for our country. Democrats believe in lower hurdles than existing policy provides in order to gain the obvious benefits which immigrants bring to our table.  Republicans believe in following our current policy until Congress improves upon them because there are risks to our nation when existing rules are violated. When anyone eagerly desires what is best for another, they are being jealous FOR the other.  In this case, both parties are being jealous for our country.  God so much wants the best for those who love Him that He calls Himself “Jealous”.",

        commentary: "Both parties want to have a positive impact on each citizen.  Democrats do tend toward more governmental presence while Republicans generally seek less.  Regardless of party, governmental influence, both good or bad, is everywhere - from our mailbox to our paycheck to our roads to the holidays we celebrate and much more.  Still, there are places largely free of governmental presence - our homes, our minds, our will.  Not so with God's presence - whether we perceive it as good or bad, He is everywhere, even in our very being.",

        commentary: "Both parties want faster and broader access to internet data.  Knowledge is power - those who do not have access to information are disadvantaged in this world. But even with perfect internet access, finding the right and accurate information we truly need is difficult.  And it will likely never be able to predict the future with 100% accuracy (even though AI may help some!).

While Democrats often seek to reduce military spending, they also seek to keep our forces unmatched in the world.  Both parties seek good through overwhelming power and authority.  But even at a spend rate of nearly one trillion dollars/year, the US military routinely runs into the human limitations of proper resourcing, prioritization and capabilities.

But they would also encourage both individuals and private enterprise to be much more compassionate towards the needy.  Both parties clearly desire to alleviate needs of the truly distressed, one focusing more on government and the other on nongovernmental agencies.  However, both often choose indirect methods to help others (i.e. just send money) versus the hands-on, side-pierced, heart-filled compassion of Christ.",
